This is my SQL homework for the week, a fantastic Amazon-esque marketplace. So awesome, it's not just Amazon.. it's BAMazon! BAMazon client allows the client to pick from a list of product and buy. If there's no product left, BAMazon will no longer allow it to be bought. If you've requested too many, it will also cut you off. But if it's in stock, you can have it, and we'll tell you how much.

As a Manager, you can list all products or products equal or less than a stock number of 5. You can also add products or quantities to existing products.

Each side also had the ability to exit BAMazon as an option for the user.

BAM!!
